== Financial Fraud Detection

As defined by Black’s Law Dictionary, fraud refers to a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment. The classification of financial fraud has not reached a consensus because the types of financial fraud are varied and mounting. We construct a financial fraud classification framework according to the major financial institution involved, as depicted in the following figure.

We identify the key challenge in financial fraud detection as the imbalanced learning problem on graphs and provide several solutions for this problem, namely re-sampling based method [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3449989 PC-GNN], metric optimization method [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485447.3512178 AO-GNN], re-weighting based method [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-00123-9_31 BLS]. The details of these models can be found in the following references.
